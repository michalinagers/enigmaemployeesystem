 # Enigma Employee Management System Website 2023

This is my work from first year of university.
This employee management system has been created using PHP, CSS, SQLite and JavaScript.
No bootstrap has been used for this website.
Using DB Browser for SQLite and xampp, a open-source software package that provides a local web server environment for testing and development.
It is connected to a database, in order to manage employees, their records, logging in, dependants, what work they are assigned to etc.
